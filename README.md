# Module 8-2 Assignment

## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User stories help interpret user needs by providing clear, concise descriptions of desired features from the user's perspective, making it easier to translate those needs into actionable tasks. They ensure the software focuses on delivering value to the user by breaking down complex requirements into manageable, prioritized tasks.

## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When developing programs, I approach the process with iterative development, breaking tasks into manageable units and continuously testing and refining based on feedback. I hope to incorporate Agile processes like Scrum, using user stories, regular collaboration, and continuous integration to ensure flexibility and user-centered value.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means communicating effectively, collaborating with others, and contributing to the team’s goals while being open to feedback and offering support to colleagues. It also involves being reliable, flexible, and focused on delivering high-quality results together.
